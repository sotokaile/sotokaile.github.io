						<h3>Tropical Rainforest</h3>
						<p>Small animals, including monkeys, birds, snakes, rodents, frogs, and lizards are common in the tropical rainforest. Many of these animals and a multitude of insects never set foot on the ground. The animals use the tall trees and understory for shelter, hiding places from their predators, and a source of food.</p>

						<h3>Desert</h3>
						<p>The animals that live in the desert usually have special adaptations that allow them to 
survive the extreme temperatures and conditions that are present in a desert. Some animals are desert elephants, dingos, hyenas, camals, foxes, and many more! </p>
