						<p> There are many different types of wild life, everywhere in this world. There are lions and zebras that can be found in the savanna. There is also bears and polar bears that can be found in a colder environment. Illegal killing of elephants for ivory decimates global populations. Estimates indicate that each year poachers slaughter close to 20,000 elephants, mostly for their tusks.</p>

						<h3>Savannah Wild Life</h3>
						<p>The African savannah, the savannah with which most people are familiar, is home to a wide variety of animals. A short list of some of those animals includes wildebeest, warthogs, elephants, zebras, rhinos, gazelles, hyenas, cheetahs, lions, leopards, ostrich, mousebirds, starlings, and weavers.</p>

						<h3>Tropical Rainforest</h3>
						<p>Small animals, including monkeys, birds, snakes, rodents, frogs, and lizards are common in the tropical rainforest. Many of these animals and a multitude of insects never set foot on the ground. The animals use the tall trees and understory for shelter, hiding places from their predators, and a source of food.</p>

						<h3>Desert</h3>
						<p>The animals that live in the desert usually have special adaptations that allow them to 
survive the extreme temperatures and conditions that are present in a desert. Some animals are desert elephants, dingos, hyenas, camals, foxes, and many more! </p>
